## Tutorial / Resources Feedback
* http://futurestud.io/blog/how-to-create-a-dynamic-handlebars-layout-template-in-hapijs/
* An appreciated example, but a bit light on where to go from here, or how to achieve a slightly more complex example
    * an example with multiple pages would have been helpful (mostly to demonstrate best practices [structure] for multiple templates)
    * also, would like to see an example using partials
